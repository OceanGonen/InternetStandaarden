            <h2 class="happy">My family</h2>
            <p>I grew up as an only child with just my mom in a small 
            apartment in Amsterdam. Most of my family lives abroad 
            and I unfortunatly hardly get to see them. On the picture
            from left to right you see my cousin, me, my aunt, my halfsister, 
            my dad and last but <strong>certainly</strong> not least, my mom. 
            I only got to meet my dad's part of the family for the first time
            not even a year ago. Which still to me is crazy to think about. 
            I especially got along with Inbar, my cousin. She is one of the
            few people I genuinely treasure from my family. We bonded very
            quickly in the short time I got to see her. Since then, she has 
            come to visit me twice in the last year and we still check up on 
            eachother on a daily bases. I truly view her and love her 
            as a sister and I'm proud to call her family.

        <h2>My friends</h2>
        <p> There are very few things I care more about than my friends. They have
             stuck by my side ever since I can remember. We have all seen eachother
             at our lowests and have carried and guided eachother through every
              situation. These are the people I'd bury a body for and I could not be 
              more grateful I get to share my life with them.
