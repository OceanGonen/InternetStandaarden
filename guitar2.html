            <h3>Lyrics:</h3>
            <p>You don't know, babe
                When you hold me
                And kiss me slowly
                It's the sweetest thing
                And it don't change
                If I had it my way  
                You would know that you are
                <br><br>
                You're the coffee that I need in the morning
                You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
                Won't you give yourself to me
                Give it all, oh
                <br><br>
                I just wanna see
                I just wanna see how beautiful you are
                You know that I see it
                I know you're a star
                Where you go I follow
                No matter how far
                If life is a movie
                Oh you're the best part, oh oh oh
                You're the best part, oh oh oh
                Best part
            </p>
