            <h3>Lyrics:</h3>
            <p>Send me your location
            Let's focus on communicating
            'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
            Send me your location
            Let's ride the vibrations
            I don't need nothing else but you
            <br><br>
            At times I wonder why I fool with you
            But this is new to me, this is new to you
            Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
            Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
            Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
            To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it, oh
            <br><br>
            So won't you send me your location
            Let's focus on communicating
            'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
            Send me your location
            Let's ride the vibrations
            I don't need nothing else but you
            </p>
