    <h2>Freelance, 2018-2020</h2>
    <p>I started freelancing when I was 18 years old. I worked at a bunch of different companies (see banner above).
      Some for a longer period than others.
      In the first couple shifts, I was mostly hired for potwash, but since I used to be very fast at my job, I often
      would have some
      spare time. Anytime that happened I offered the kitchen staff a helping hand. After a few months, one employer
      wanted to hire me as a fulltime cook.
      I accepted their offer immediately. My boss was so pleased with my dedication and the work that I put in, that
      they gave me the position of 'Head of Catering'.
      I was very grateful for the incredible opportunity. Even though it was quite stressful, since I had to oversee the
      lunch buffet for over 150 people, it
      allowed me to train my social skills, improve my performance under pressure and also taught me plenty of
      responsibility and
      accountability at a very young age.

      <h2>Headchef at Stroom in de Pijp, <br>2021-2023 </h2>
      <p>Stroom in de Pijp is a very nice family dine-cafe. They serve a very diverse menu, from pulled chicken waffles
        to Tom Kha kai. I didn't have full control
        over the menu like most headchefs would, but I constantly was coming up with new ideas or improvements regarding
        the menu or increasing the overall efficiency of the kitchen. I was
        also fully accountable for all the food that came out. It was a very fun and insightful experience, but it
        eventually became hard to sustain
        because of a shortage of staff after the pandemic hit. The restaurant became reliant on my availibilty and I had
        trouble combining work with my personal life.
        So I eventually quit and started looking for a position that wasn't as dependent of me.

      <h2>Chef de Parti at Gate Gourmet, <br>2023-present </h2>
      <p>Gate Gourmet is an international production kitchen near Schiphol airport responsible for all airplane meals
        from many airline companies. Most known of which are Delta airlines,
        Aero Mexico, Singapor airlines, United Emirates, China southern among many more. My job is to prep 'special'
        meals (for passengers with allergies or requests)
        and cook for the flight crew and business class. As chef de Parti I have the additional task to oversee if the
        daily quota has been met and everything is ready to get on the plane.
        As you can see from the image on the left, the hygiene regulations are very strict, which makes a lot of sense
        of course, but it's not to the same extent I'm
        normally used to from working in prior kitchens. Luckily I adapted fairly quickly and was able to earn the
        responsibility of the position I'm currently in.
